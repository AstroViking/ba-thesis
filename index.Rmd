# Abstract {-}

Multiple implementations of a one-dimensional Kernel Density Estimation based on TensorFlow and Zfit are proposed. Starting from the basic algorithm, several optimizations from recent papers are introduced and combined to ameliorate the efficiency of the algorithm. By comparing its accuracy and efficiency to implementations in pure Python it is shown as competitive and useful in real world applications. The newly proposed KDE implementation achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as well as efficiency for large one-dimensional data $>10^8$ and may also provide runtime benefits for cases where the probability density estimate needs to be computed once but evaluated repeatedly.
Furthermore it is designed to be run on parallel on multiple machines/GPUs. It is therefore optimally suited for very large datasets, as the ones produced in experimental high energy physics.

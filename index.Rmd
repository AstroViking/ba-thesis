# Abstract {-}

This study aims at comparing the speed and accuracy of differentu methods for one-dimensional kernel density estimation in Python/TensorFlow, especially concerning applications in high energy physics.

Starting from the basic algorithm, several optimizations from recent papers are introduced and combined to ameliorate the efficiency of the algorithm.
